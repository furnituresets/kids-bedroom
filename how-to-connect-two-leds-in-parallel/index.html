Ohm&#39;s law dictates the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance. Try to get a 3 volt power supply (no arduino, no extra stuff) and try your parallel leds again. If the led was manufactured slightly differently it might require 2.1 volts or maybe 1.9 volts to push 20 ma thru it. Each strip runs along two sides of the rectangle, coming together at the opposite corner from the power supply.

<p>This is what allows us to simply cut the led strip lights in intervals of 3. When you wire in series, you add the forward voltages of each led in the circuit but the current fed to each led remains the same. When you put led drivers in parallel, it maintains a lower forward voltage. Each strip runs along two sides of the rectangle, coming together at the opposite corner from the power supply.

<p>Usually when adding multiple leds into a system you want to run them in series, this allows for consistent current across each led so they light more. Ohm's law dictates the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance. In other words, the 3 leds are connected in series, but the groups of 3 leds are connected to one another in parallel.
