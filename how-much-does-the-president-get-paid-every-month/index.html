Trump and his constituents have not yet announced where he will donate his salary for the first and second quarters of 2020. Being that the president makes $400,000 a year, works 91 hours a week and works 49 weeks per year, we can say that the president makes about $89.71 an hour. As of sep 13, 2022, the average monthly pay for a president in the united states is $7,175 a month. It means that muhammadu buhari takes home at least one million naira every month.
